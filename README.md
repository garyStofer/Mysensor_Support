# Mysensor_Support
This repo contains tools and projects to aide in the develpment and debugging of a MySensors wireless network.  

To build the arduinio sniffer project expand the Arduino folder found in the zip file into the Arduino Sketch folder
and build with the same MYsensor library as the wireless nodes are built. Make sure that the network ID number and channel matches 
 between the sniffer and nodes/coordinator.
